# 4.1 TEA Project's Dual Token Design
The two tokens in the TEA ecosystem are the TEA utility token and the Camellia (CML) NFT. The two tokens play different roles towards incentivizing participation among TEA ecosystem participants. The TEA token is the token that users must pay when using the network's TApps. TEA is also used to incentivize miners who earn TEA revenue in exchange for the service their nodes provide the TEA network. CML are issued by the DAO according to demand, with the TEA that's exchanged for CML being burned by the DAO. 

We envision demand for the two tokens to come from multiple factors:

- **CML** is required for mining on the network so miners will buy it to make their mining nodes active. There are three different types of Camellia: A, B, and C CML. A CML maintain TEA's state machine, B CML host TApps, and C CML can only host TApps for private data.
- **TEA** is exchanged for CML for those who wish to earn mining revenue. But its primary demand will stem from those needing it to use TApps. This creates demand for TEA as users will need to bridge assets over from different blockchains in order to exchange for TEA. Every decentralized app running on the TEA network, called TApps, will each have their own TApp token as an investment and fundraising vehicle for the TApp. Users will need to use TEA to purchase these TApp tokens, another source of demand for TEA.

## 4.2 Camellia NFT's Role in the TEA Ecosystem
Camellia (CML) is a non-fungible token (NFT) that's used by TEA miners to activate their mining machines. The CML tokens essentially act as both an ID mechanism for their mining nodes as well as an access key that allows them to mine on the TEA network. The CML that is associated with a mining machine tracks that machine's trustworthiness (e.g. uptime). This information on each CML ID is stored on the TEA Project's layer-1 blockchain. In a scenario where the miner wishes to upgrade their hardware, moving the CML to their new machine also transfers its trust score.

Miners must pay 1000T as a deposit for mining. This amount is automatically withdrawn from the miner's wallet when they plant a CML. If a miner doesn't have enough TEA tokens for the 1000T initial staking slot, then they may take on debt. TEA token loans will only be for the beginning epochs and are designed to boost the supply of TEA in the early stages of the network. 

Camellia start off as seeds and have different productive potentials and lifespans. Every CML has a life span that mimics organic plants - it grows from a seed, matures into a fully productive tree, and eventually dies. A mining CML mimics this same life cycle through its productive phases: it yields relatively less TEA near the beginning and end of its life and produces the most TEA at its middle-age peak. This natural life cycle CML helps keep the miner network decentralized as even early-adopters must compete with newcomers for new seeds when theirs die off.

The DAO is in charge of generating new CML tokens. The supply (birth rate of CMLs) is controlled by the DAO based on the level of demand for new CMLs. These new CML seeds are auctioned off to prospective miners; the TEA received in return for the CML seeds are burned by the DAO based on prevailing supply and demand. These selective burns help support the TEA token economy by limiting the supply of TEA.

## 4.3 The TEA Token's Role in the TEA Ecosystem
TEA is a utility token used by the network to pay miners and by clients to run decentralized TApps. As a utility token, it's also used to pay gas on the network. The unit cost of computing resources such as cpu utilization, ram, network traffic, and storage should be relatively stable when measured in terms of TEA tokens:

The TEA Project will generate initial tokens in its genesis block to distribute to investors and team members. The pre-mined amount is 100 million TEA tokens. From that point on, TEA will be generated solely from Camellia mining. 

Camellia mining gives miners a chance to earn block rewards from performing routine tasks such as running remote attestation of computing nodes, proposing new blocks, and running smart contracts. Decentralized applications (known as **TApps**) will need miners with computing nodes to host them (i.e. machines with a CML token planted). In return for hosting TApps, miners will either earn a share of that TApp's token or be paid out in TEA tokens. The TEA tokens that are rewarded to miners for hosting a TApp that's elected to payout in TEA will come from consume actions (i.e. usage of the app) or be paid out directly by cashing out the TApp's token for TEA to be paid by the miners. 

The TEA token has many uses on the TEA Project platform:

- TEA pays for gas when performing any transaction on the network.
- TEA is used by consumers to pay for TApps they want to use.
- For miners, TEA can be part of the reward for mining on the network.
- Users can also stake TEA to mining nodes to share in a percentage of mining rewards. Staking is a way for investors to lock up their TEA tokens and earn revenue. Giving users the option to stake their TEA locks it up and helps support the token price.
- TEA tokens can be staked by users to vote on DAO governance issues.

## Factors that Influence the Mining of TEA
Any node in the TEA network doesn't know what computing tasks will be assigned to their node. But there are many factors that a miner can take into account to help their nodes be chosen for high TEA revenue tasks. The TEA Project's Proof of Trust consensus will probabilistically favor nodes that:

-   Are higher productivity machines, i.e. more powerful hardware. 
-   A higher productivity type of plant, i.e. their CML is at middle-age.
-   Higher total stake value from investors staking into the machine.
-   Some special features that others machines do not have, e.g. an onboard TPU.

## CML Mining Machines and Its Bonding Curve Tokens
Miners are able to earn TEA tokens by running public service jobs (like remote attestation) and executing customer compute tasks as assigned by the TEA network. This income is shared with investors who decide to invest funds into the mining machine through its bonding curve token. 

Each Camellia has a bonding curve token associated with it that investors can purchase. The stakers therefore have a claim on a percentage that the mining machine earns as mining revenue. This allows non-technical users (or uses who don't have the space or bandwidth to run a mining machine) to earn TEA revenue by participating in mining without having to setup and administer a mining machine.

The timing of when these bonding curve tokens are purchased matter when it comes time to distribute the mining revenue. The earlier the purchase time, the cheaper the price of the bonding curve tokens. And the earlier the purchase time, the more chances the token holder will have to earn dividend payouts according to the amount of tokens they hold. Dividends are paid out in the Camellia's bonding curve token. Because it's a bonding curve, token holders can cash out to TEA at any time at the price determined by the bonding curve.

## The Supply of CML and TEA
#### CML Supply
CML supply is algorithmically determined based on demand for miners to host TApps on the network. Code monitors how busy / idle the miners are on the network. New CML are issued and put up for auction if miner utilization passes a set threshold in order to put some slack back into the system. TEA supply is reduced when someone buys CML through an open bidding process. After the miner or investor purchases CML, the TEA used in the purchase is burned by the DAO.

#### TEA Supply
The genesis block contains 100 million TEA tokens to be distributed as follows:

- Seed round investors: 10% (10 million TEA).
- A round investors: 10% (10 million TEA).
- B round investors: 10% (10 million TEA).
- Team tokens: 30% (30 million TEA).
- Operations and marketing: 8% (8 million TEA).
- Community: 6% (6 million TEA).
- Liquidity pool rewards: 6% (6 million TEA).
- Potential IDO round (i.e. parachain auction staker reward): 20% (20 million TEA).

#### Block Rewards
- TEA token reward reduction rate for every half-year:	0.7	(30% reduction in block reward rate after every 6 months during the first 2 years).
- How many blocks in half a year:		2,635,200		
- Initial public service reward per block at Genesis Block	9.06944			
- Initial mining rewards per block: 7T (A CML) + 2T (B CML) + .06944 (layer-1 staking)
