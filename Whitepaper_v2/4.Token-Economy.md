# 4.1 TEA Project's Dual Token Design
The two tokens in the TEA ecosystem are the TEA utility token and the Camelia (CML) NFT. The two tokens play different roles towards incentivizing participation among TEA ecosystem participants. TEA is only generated by miners who earn TEA revenue in exchange for the service their nodes provide the TEA network. CML are issued by the DAO according to demand, with the TEA that's exchanged for CML being burned by the DAO. 

We envision demand for the two tokens to come from multiple factors:

- **CML** is required for mining on the network so miners will buy it to make their mining nodes active. Additional demand will come from retail investors who can choose to stake CML to a mining machine in order to earn a portion of its revenue. NFTs have become popular in their own right, and the CML TEA Project NFTs will be inviting for those who wish to collect a new kind of NFT.
- **TEA** is exchanged for CML for all the reasons listed above. This creates demand for TEA as users will need to bridge assets over from different blockchains in order to purchase CML. Every decentralized app running on the TEA network, called TApps, will each have their own TApp token as an investment and fundraising vehicle for the TApp. Users will need to use TEA to purchase these TApp tokens, another source of demand for TEA.

## 4.2 Camellia NFT's Role in the TEA Ecosystem
Camellia (CML) is a non-fungible token (NFT) that's used by TEA miners to activate their mining machines. The CML tokens essentially act as both an ID mechanism for their mining nodes as well as an access key that allows them to mine on the TEA network. The CML that is associated with a mining machine tracks that machine's trustworthiness (e.g. uptime) as well as its roster of stakers. This information on each CML ID is stored on the TEA Project's layer-1 blockchain. In a scenario where the miner wishes to upgrade their hardware, moving the CML to their new machine also transfers its trust score and its roster of stakers.

Camellia start off as seeds and have different productive potentials and lifespans. Every CML has a life span that mimics organic plants - it grows from a seed, matures into a fully productive tree, and eventually dies. A mining CML mimics this same life cycle through its productive phases: it yields relatively less TEA near the beginning and end of its life and produces the most TEA at its middle-age peak. This natural life cycle CML helps keep the miner network decentralized as even early-adopters must compete with newcomers for new seeds when theirs die off.

The DAO is in charge of generating new CML tokens. The supply (birth rate of CMLs) is controlled by the DAO based on the level of demand for new CMLs. These new CML seeds are auctioned off to prospective miners; the TEA received in return for the CML seeds are burned by the DAO based on prevailing supply and demand. These selective burns help support the TEA token economy by limiting the supply of TEA.

Mining is not the sole source of demand for CML.

- Users can purchase CML and stake it to an active mining machine, which will entitle them to a share of that mining machine's harvest. This staking option for CML holders allows users who don't have the time, technical knowledge, or temperament for mining to take part in mining rewards without having to setup a mining machine.
- A CML is an NFT that is collectible in its own right. Holders can elect to leave CML in its frozen state to indefinitely hold onto CML as part of their collection.

## 4.3 The TEA Token's Role in the TEA Ecosystem
TEA is a utility token used by the network to pay miners and by clients to run decentralized TApps. As a utility token, it's also used to pay gas on the network. The TEA token is designed to be a stable token pegged to the average cost of computing resources such as cpu utilization, ram, network traffic, and storage. TEA being stable relative to computing resources gives users cost-certainty regarding how much they'll pay for app usage.  As computing resources get cheaper with the passing of time, the value of $T should also drop when measured by a currency like USD. But the cost to perform a unit computing taks should remain stable when measured in TEA.

Many blockchain projects will generate initial tokens in their genesis block to distribute to investors and team members. This is not the case with TEA because only frozen CML seeds exist in the beginning. The only initial TEA tokens in the TEA Project will be a very small amount in the genesis block to cover the initial gas fee. From that point on, TEA will be generated solely from Camellia mining. 

Just like the Bitcoin network, all new TEA tokens are generated and awarded as part of the mining process. This is where miners perform routine tasks such as running remote attestation of computing nodes, proposing new blocks, and running smart contracts. Decentralized applications (known as **TApps**) will need miners with computing nodes to host them (i.e. machines with a CML token planted). In return for hosting TApps, miners will either earn a share of that TApp's token or be paid out in TEA tokens. The TEA tokens that are rewarded to miners for hosting a TApp that's elected to payout in TEA will come from consume actions (i.e. usage of the app) or be paid out directly by cashing out the TApp's token for TEA to be paid by the miners. 

The TEA token has many uses on the TEA Project platform:

- TEA pays for gas when performing any transaction on the network.
- TEA is used by consumers to pay for TApps they want to use.
- For miners, TEA can be part of the reward for mining on the network.
- Users can also stake TEA to mining nodes to share in a percentage of that node's mining rewards.
- TEA tokens can be staked by users to vote on DAO governance issues.

## Factors that Influence the Mining of TEA
Any node in the TEA network doesn't know what computing tasks will be assigned to their node. But there are many factors that a miner can take into account to help their nodes be chosen for high TEA revenue tasks. The TEA Project's Proof of Trust consensus will probabilistically favor nodes that:

-   Are higher productivity machines, i.e. more powerful hardware. 
-   A higher productivity type of plant, i.e. their CML is at middle-age.
-   Higher total stake value from investors staking into the machine.
-   Some special features that others machines do not have, e.g. an onboard TPU.

## Staking into CML Mining Machines
Miners are able to earn TEA tokens by running public service jobs (like remote attestation) and executing customer compute tasks as assigned by the TEA network. This income is shared with investors who decide to invest funds into the mining machine.

Each Camellia has a stack of “stake slots” investors can stake their CML or TEA into. The stakers therefore have a claim on a percentage that the mining machine earns as mining revenue. This allows non-technical users (or uses who don't have the space or bandwidth to run a mining machine) to earn TEA revenue by participating in mining without having to setup and administer a mining machine.

The position of the stake slots gives different weights to each staker when distributing revenue. The lower the index of the staker (the closer it is to the bottom), the higher the weight it gets in revenue. The staking slot with index zero is dedicated to the miner themselves and is the most productive. This is the only staking slot that cannot unstake unless the miner sells their Camellia. Other stakers above the zero-slot can unstake their stake slots at any trading window. However, once they unstake, the upper slots will all slide down to fill up the space left by the departed staker.

The first 0-index staking slot costs 1000T and is automatically withdrawn from the miner's wallet when they plant a CML. A staker can use a CML seed instead of 1000T for their staking slot, but a miner at the zero-index doesn't have this option. If a miner doesn't have enough TEA tokens for the 1000T initial staking slot, then they may take on debt. TEA token loans will only be for the beginning epochs and are designed to boost the supply of TEA in the early stages of the network. TEA is only ever farmed by miners, so there will be a lack of TEA supply in the early stages as young CML seeds need time to grow into TEA-producing trees.

Staking slots are a way for investors to lock up their TEA tokens and earn revenue. Giving users the option to stake their TEA locks it up and helps support the token price.

## The Supply of CML and TEA
#### CML Supply
The genesis block contains 10,000 CML to be distributed as follows:
- Seed round investors: 10% (1000 CML).
- A round investors: 10% (1000 CML).
- Potential IDO round (i.e. parachain auction staker reward): 20% (2000 CML).
- Community / team / reserve kept by the TEA Project DAO: 60% (6000 CML).

#### TEA Supply
There's only a minuscule amount of TEA in the genesis block for the purpose of paying the initial gas. Beyond that, all TEA is generated through mining rewards awarded to CML-planted mining nodes. TEA supply is reduced when someone buys CML through an open bidding process. After the miner or investor purchases CML, the TEA used in the purchase is burned by the DAO.
