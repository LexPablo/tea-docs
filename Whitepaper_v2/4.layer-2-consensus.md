The design of the TEA Project's layer-2 consensus ensures that even if transactions are missing (e.g. the transaction is delayed by network congestion), the ordering of transactions will still be correct. The TEA Project is able to achieve a reliable ordering of transactions through its use of replicas and CRDT databases.

- Delegators send **transaction hashes** and **transaction receipts** to multiple replicas. These followup receipts have timestamps that show when the original tx hash was sent out.
- Replicas match the hashes of transactions with their followup receipts. Replicas can re-order transactions as long as they remain within a period of time relative to the now time of the replica's clock.
- A decentralized, peer-to-peer sync function between replicas keeps a CRDT database of ordered transactions among all replicas. Because it's **conflict-free**, the sync function can only add a missing transaction hash to a replica when it's missing on their ledger compared to other replicas on the network.

## How Transactions are Generated & Processed Through the TEA Network

Because it takes time for a delegator to package up a transaction and create its hash, this transaction doesn't have a timestamp of when it was sent out.

You can imagine the delegator sealing the envelope of the transaction before sending it out to other replicas on the network. Since the envelope is sealed, there's no way to include the sent timestamp within the envelope.
