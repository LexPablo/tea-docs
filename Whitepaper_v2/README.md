## Outline for Whitepaper v2 

### A. Litepaper
Litepaper will be a 10,000 foot overview of the TEA Project.

It will summarize the project's aims starting from the premises laid out in **Fixing a Broken Internet**, namely how do we run rich dApps at full speed while enjoying the decentralization of blockchain and keeping everything secure. It will emphasize how the TEA Project uses Proof of Trust (via TPM) and Proof of Time (via GPS) to achieve trust across its nodes.

Following this overview, there will be brief sections on the components of the TEA Project. Each of these sections will have links for further information that go more in-depth on the topics brought up in the section. These chapters are designed to be concise and can be read through relatively quickly without getting lost.

- Proof of Trust data kept in layer-1 blockchain.
- Remote attestation.

### Section2: Proof of Time / GPS

### Section 3: Layer-1 Blockchain

### Section 4: Layer-2 Consensus layer
