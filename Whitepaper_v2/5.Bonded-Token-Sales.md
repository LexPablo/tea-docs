## TApp Bonded Token Sales
The TEA Project offers decentralized app developers the ability to raise funding through the sale of **TApp tokens**. Each TApp can have an ERC20-compatible fungible token associated with it in order to raise funds and reward those who wish to invest in the project. 

Whoever holds a TApp's tokens owns some percentage of the project. These tokens tokenize ownership of the project and are a claim to revenue dividends distributed to the project's stakeholders. The token availability for a TApp allows for users of the TApp to become investors in it.

## TApp Tokens: Bonding Curves
TApp tokens follow a bonding curve where price programatically increases as supply increases. A TApp's tokens can be traded in to its bonding curve (buy or sell) at any time for TEA tokens. These tokens can also be traded outside of the Tea Project as a standard ERC20 token.

Every bonding curve has a theta value, also known as the reserve rate. The theta value determines how much of every payment into the bonding curve is reserved for the bonding curve. In the picture below, **theta x gross TEA amount** of every buy into the bonding curve goes into the reserve fund (the area under the blue line). This ensures that everybody who buys into the bonding curve can sell back into it. The sell line will take time to move higher than the buy line for any token purchase, which incentivizes investors to hold the token.

The area between the red **sell** line and the blue **buy** line in the graphic above is the portion that goes to developers from any funds going into the bonding curve. This is considered the developer's **funding pool**, a floating source of capital that is used to pay developers, licensing costs, or any other expenses related to the development of the TApp. As an example, a TApp's creators might have a bonding curve where the token's price = supply^2 with a theta (reserve rate) of 0.9, keeping (1 - .9) = 10% for their own development expenses and salaries.
