## The TEA Project's Two Layer Setup for Faster Dapps
The TEA Project's goal is to build a platform that allows code and data to run inside TEA modules with complete trust. The technologies built into the TEA platform protects the data and makes sure:

-   The computation is based on the expected code and expected data. No one can alter the input code, the input data, nor the output result.
-   The result of the computation is correct given the computing environment is verified and there's no data breach during the whole process.

The TEA Project has made completely trustable nodes on its layer-2 possible through the following factors:

-   TEA nodes connect to each other through a peer-to-peer network.
-   Every TEA node is protected and monitored by hardware TPM chips or the CPU's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). The TPM can provide PoT (Proof of Trust) data. If utilizing the CPU, the CPU's TEE will rely on the manufacturer's verification.
-   Every TEA node can verify any other TEA node's integrity through a remote attestation process. The verification is controlled and determined by blockchain smart contracts.
-   Anyone outside the TEA module's hardware has no access to what's inside the module. In addition, neither the TEA node's owner nor the TApp developer can predict which node is running or will run any particular task.
-   After the task is done, anyone can verify the Proof of Trust data of how their code or data was processed.

## The TEA Project's Layer-1
TEA's layer-1 blockchain is responsible for the security and overall trust of the TEA Project. Layer-1 keeps trust certificates on all the nodes running on layer-2. Each layer-2 node must be in good standing based on the information reported by the node's TPM chip under the watch of remote attestation. 

Here's how the remote attestation process works in conjunction with the TPM chips onboard the mining computers to ensure each node is trustable:

1. Multiple nodes are randomly called to conduct remote attestation on any particular node under inspection.
2. The results of these remote attestations are stored in the layer-1 blockchain as Proof of Trust (PoT) data.

Succesful remote attestation on a candidate node ensures that the machine's TPM chip hasn't been tampered with. The secure enclave overseen by the TPM chip is therefore trustable and will protect the confidentiality of both the code and data processed within the enclave. This is the fundamental premise of the TEA Project's concept of **trust**: if a node shows full integrity under remote attestations performed by multiple peer nodes, then its enclave is secure and the resulting calculations (i.e. app output) can be trusted.

## How TEA's Layer-1 Conducts Remote Attestation
TEA's consensus protocol 

In the TEA network, each trusted computing node has a Root of Trust (RoT): a key pair generated by the TPM manufacturer. The private key for this RoT is held inside the hardware, and not known to anyone, including the manufacturer. The public key is disclosed and recorded on the blockchain. Periodically, the blockchain will run remote attestation by requesting a computational node to generate its hardware fingerprint and fingerprints for all the software modules running in the node. These will need to be signed by the TPM’s private key before being returned as the response to the attestation request. Each attesting node would verify the signature and the Proof of Trust (PoT) data that has been returned. 

TEA's layer-1 consensus protocol randomly selects remote attestation nodes to challenge the randomly selected node being tested. If a 2/3 (two-thirds) majority of remote attestation nodes receive a positive result from veryifying the target node's requested attestation material, the tested node will have passed the consensus verification and be marked as trustable to use. Note that trustable nodes are the only ones selectable to perform the remote attestation process. Therefore, as long as the network can keep a minimum ratio of 2/3 (two-thirds) trustable nodes, we can trust the consensus result. To maintain this minimum threshold, the TEA Project team needs to bootstrap the network with clean nodes and control the birth rate of new nodes (i.e. control the issuance of Camellia NFTs needed to mine on the TEA network).

The results from all attesting nodes will run through the blockchain's consensus protocol before a final decision is made on whether the computing node still meets all the security requirements for it to remain on the network. Finally, the result of the attestation process is recorded on the blockchain. 

The different layers of software running in the computational node generate their own secrets, one after another, each using the parent layer’s key pairs so that all of them can pass cryptographic verification. These nodes together form a trust chain with the root of the chain being the hardware RoT. Because the public key of the RoT is stored in the blockchain publicly, anyone can easily verify any derived secrets by tracking back the chain-of-trust, and eventually verify the RoT using data recorded on the blockchain.

## The Technical Implementation of the TEA Project's Layer-1 Blockchain
We have developed our layer-1 blockchain using Substrate as the provider. But TEA can work with any layer-1 blockchain that has smart contract support will work with TEA, such as Ethereum etc. 

- Chains such as Ethereum that are not based on Substrate will need some type of smart contract (as in a bridge) to link messages between the chains at low-bandwidth and transfers funds (at the expense of gas fees from the connected chain).
- For Substate-based chains, the TEA Project's layer-2 can communicate with the Substrate-based layer-1 chain using XCMP. XCMP, or **Cross-Chain Message Passing**, is based on XCM, or **Cross-Consensus Message Format**, and is a method for Substrate-based chains to communicate with each other.

We chose Substrate because it's modern, fast, release-ready, and written in Rust and WASM (the same tech that the TEA Project is built on). Like Polkadot, the TEA Project uses the **GRANDPA** consensus algorithm for block finality. GRANDPA achieves consensus using asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT), allowing messages to be be received and re-broadcast across all nodes before they are commited. This allows nodes to recover from potential message loss and is a robust BFT consensus algorithm for asynchronous networks. 

The TEA Project's layer-1 is also responsible for the following:

- Economic incentives and penalties that form the basis of its token economy.
- Immutable trust information storage, such as credit history, key IDs, and hashes.
- Verifies blocks and maintains the block height as a universal clock between TEA nodes.

## The TEA Project's Layer-2
TEA's layer-1 is rock-solid for both security and decentralization, but the Byzantine fault tolerance it must perform for its consensus means that it's slow. It's an example of why you generally don’t want to do computing inside blockchain: complicated algorithms cannot run in smart contracts due to computational cost and time needed for completion. That's why the TEA Project has evolved a layer-2 to be able to run dApps at full speed while relying on TEA's layer-1 for trust.

## Trust Allows WebAssembly Code to Run Full Speed
As the TEA Project's layer-1 verifies the trustable status of each node, developers can run their decentralized apps at native speeds on layer-2. At the application layer, it's only strictly required that developers use WebAssembly (WASM) to deploy code to the TEA-runtime. The security built into the WebAssembly language itself also helps to secure the network. Using WASM is also conducive for developing applications on the TEA ecosystem. Most modern programming languages can be compiled into the WebAssesmbly code format. Developers can stick with their preferred programming languages to write their apps which speeds up development on the TEA platform.

TEA Project's layer-2 currently uses the file storage and networking services provided by IPFS. Any current IPFS miner can begin participating in the TEA network by adding a TEA hardware security module (such as a Raspberry Pi with a TPM chip).
