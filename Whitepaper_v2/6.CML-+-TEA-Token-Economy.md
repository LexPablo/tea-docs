The two tokens in the TEA ecosystem are the TEA utility token and the CML NFT.

## The TEA Token
TEA is a utility token used by the network to pay miners and by clients to run decentralized TApps. As a utility token, it's also used to pay gas on the network. The TEA token is designed to be a stable token pegged to the average cost of computing resources such as cpu utilization, ram, network traffic, and storage. TEA being stable relative to computing resources gives users cost-certainty regarding how much they'll pay for app usage.  As computing resources get cheaper with the passing of time, the value of $T should also drop when measured by a currency like USD. But the cost to perform a unit computing taks should remain stable when measured in $T.

Users can vote on DAO governance issues by staking TEA tokens. TEA can also be written as **$T** and has the **T** ticker symbol. 

Many blockchain projects will generate initial tokens in their genesis block to distribute to investors and team members. This is not the case with $T because only frozen CML seeds exist in the beginning. There are initially no TEA tokens in the TEA ecosystem as TEA is generated solely from Camellia mining. 

Just like the Bitcoin network, all new $T tokens are generated and awarded as part of the mining process. This is where miners perform routine tasks such as running remote attestation of computing nodes, proposing new blocks, and running smart contracts. Once decentralized applications (known as **TApps**) are used by clients, miners with computing nodes (i.e. machines with a CML token planted) will start to earn $T tokens by executing tasks for these clients. Miners will actually earn more $T tokens by running tasks for clients compared to running routine tasks for the TEA network.

## The Camellia NFT
Camellia (CML) is a non-fungible token (NFT) that's used by TEA miners to activate their mining machines. The CML tokens essentially act as both an ID mechanism for their mining nodes as well as an access key that allows them to mine on the TEA network. The CML that is associated with a mining machine tracks that machine's trustworthiness (e.g. uptime) as well as its roster of stakers. This information on each CML ID is stored on the TEA Project's layer-1 blockchain. In a scenario where the miner wishes to upgrade their hardware, moving the CML to their new machine also transfers its trust score and its roster of stakers.

Camellia start off as seeds and have different productive potentials and lifespans. Every CML has a life span that mimics organic plants - it grows from a seed, matures into a fully productive tree, and eventually dies. A mining CML mimics this same life cycle through its productive phases: it yields relatively less TEA near the beginning and end of its life and produces the most TEA at its middle-age peak. This natural life cycle CML helps keep the miner network decentralized as even early-adopters must compete with newcomers for new seeds when theirs die off.

The DAO is in charge of generating new CML tokens. The supply (birth rate of CMLs) is controlled by the DAO based on the level of demand for new CMLs. These new CML seeds are auctioned off to prospective miners; the $T received in return for the CML seeds are burned by the DAO based on prevailing supply and demand. These selective burns help support the $T token economy by limiting the supply of $T.


## Factors that Influence the Mining of TEA
Any node in the TEA network doesn't node what computing tasks will be assigned to their node. But there are many factors that a miner can take into account to help their nodes be chosen for high TEA revenue tasks. The TEA Project's Proof of Trust consensus will probabilistically favor nodes that:

-   Are higher productivity machines e.g., at middle-age.
-   A higher productivity type of plant, e.g., a more powerful hardware.
-   Higher total stake value from investors staking into the machine.
-   Some special features that others machines do not have, e.g., onboard TPU.

## Staking into CML Mining Machines
Miners are able to earn $T tokens by running public service jobs (like remote attestation) and executing customer compute tasks as assigned by the TEA network. This income is shared with investors who decide to invest funds into the mining machine.

Each camellia has a stack of “stake slots” that investors can stake their $T into. Similar to investing in a company, the investors are shareholders. They earn dividends from the camellia through sharing in its mining revenue. This allows for non-techncial users (or uses who don't have the space or bandwidth to run a mining machine) to earn TEA revenue form mining.

The position of the stake slots gives different weights to each staker when distributing revenue. The lower the index of the staker (the closer it is to the bottom), the higher the weight it gets in revenue. The staking slot with index zero is dedicated to the miner themselves and is the most productive. This is the only staking slot that cannot unstake unless the miner sells their camellia. Investors on the other hand can unstake their stake slots at any trading window. However, once they unstake, the upper slots will all slide down to fill up the space left by the departed staker.

The first 0-index staking slot costs 1000T and is automatically withdrawn from the miner's wallet when they plant a CML. A staker can use a CML seed instead of 1000T. If a miner doesn't have enough TEA tokens for the 1000 buy-in, then they may take on debt. TEA token loans will only be for the beginning epochs and are designed to boost the supply of TEA in the early stages of the network. TEA is only ever farmed by miners, so there will be a lack of TEA supply in the early stages as young CML seeds need time to grow into TEA-producing trees.

Staking slots are a way for investors to lock up their TEA tokens and earn revenue. Giving users the option to stake their TEA locks up $T and helps support the token price.
