# Deploy your own picture and run the same Tensorflow function to detect image
In our first easy start demo. You run a existing dApp to detect an pre-deployed image using Tensorflow algorithm. 
Now you can try to deploy your own image and use the same algorithm to detect.

# Deploy your own image
Click <a href="">Data dpeloyment tool</a> to start.

The first step is very similar to the Easy Start demo dApp. You will need to select a delegator node. If you have your own TEA node, you can select it from the lower table. If you do not, you can select any of the four bootstrap nodes in the upper table. In our screenshot I selected Bob.

You can click "Upload the data image" and upload your local image to the delegator node.
If you do not have a image, please download any pre-made test image from below.

![test img3](https://github.com/tearust/tea-docs/blob/main/res/tiger.jpg?raw=true)
All these images are tested working with Tensorflow algorithm.

Once you selected the image, now select account. This is the same as what we did in Easy Start demo. 
The description is how you price your data. In TEA network, users own their own data not the service provider. You can list a price model such as "pay per use". However use your data (reference your deployment_id) to run any algorithm need to pay you the price you listed here. You can get revenue from offering your valuable data to others. The privacy is protected by hardware and cryptographic algorithm. 
We can keep the price as is for now. Just click next to continue.

This is the last page. Your data has been deployed with the deployment_id in the red box. Please copy and paste the deployment_id somewhere. This id represent your data in the TEA network. However would like to use your data needs to reference this ID. You will need it in the upcoming step.

The deployment is a life-long process. But after a few seconds, you can click "Find provider" button and "Refresh" button to see who has "pinned" your data.

In the screenshot above, you can see there are 4 nodes "pinned" your data. All those 4 nodes are "pinner" of your data deployment. This means if someone need to use your data need to get the detail from one of those pinners. Of course they get paid too for offerring such repin service.
