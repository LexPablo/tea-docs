### What’s Ahead in Epoch 6

There’s plenty of new features ahead for epoch 6 launching in the coming week, from improvements in the token economy to new TApps and new forms of mining.

-   Contestants in the mining contests will buy CML using their own funds. Both B & C CML will be available for sale and transferred after payment to the contestants’ accounts. Participants can choose to pay in either BNB or BUSDT on the Binance Smart Chain.
-   There’s a new **Tea Party** template for TApp creators to create social media style messaging apps within the TEA browser wallet. The team will host one TApp using this template as a help desk for contestants to ask questions.
-   Mining with B CML still involves setting up a virtual machine, but now C CML can earn mining rewards by verifying the availability of B nodes. This process is called [Availability Attestation](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining---Availability-Attestation) and rewards are paid out even if no B nodes are found to be offline.

Users wishing to join the epoch 6 mining contest can sign up through [the contest form](https://forms.gle/B2ZPnWgXd9FjiXFx9).
