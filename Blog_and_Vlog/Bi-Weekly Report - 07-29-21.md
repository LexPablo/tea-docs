# Preview of the TEA Browser Wallet Released

Preview 1 of the TEA Project's browser wallet is live at https://http://68.183.182.174/. In addition to the typical wallet functions of storing tokens, users can also mine their CML and stake both CML and TEA. There's also a marketplace built into the wallet to allow CML sales. 

We're especially looking to onboard miners as they will form the backbone of the TEA network. To reach this goal, we're preparing a mining contest in August. The miners who mine the most tokens during the competition will receive rewards, possibly USDT or CML.

To learn how to start earning revenue with the TEA browser wallet, check out our [mining & staking tutorial](https://teaproject.org/#/doc_list/Try_the_demo%2FREADME.md) which includes a video tutorial.

# Website Upgrade

The website is getting refreshed over the next few weeks to better reflect the status of the TEA Project. As our underlying tech evolves, the documentation needs to be updated to properly reflect TEA Project updates. This emphasis on clarity will help more users who visit our site understand the benefits of using the TEA Project. 

Some of these updates also include: 

- A new intro video at the top of the homepage.

- A new TEA Project logo.

# Introduction to the 2nd TEA Project Phase: RafTEA

RafTEA is the 2nd phase of TEA Project's development. The first phase was called "T-rust" and focused on the trust platform and the mining portal. The RafTEA phase is focused on TApps ecosystem, an investment platform. Being able to use Raft consensus on our layer-2 is an important technical milestone. You can read more about the technical details of our implementation of Raft [here](https://github.com/tearust/moderators/blob/main/RafTEA/README.md).

# Preparing for the Series A Funding Round
With our seed round completed, we now turn to securing our Series A funding round. We're updating content important to investors (pitch deck, whitepaper, website documentation) to properly reflect an evolving TEA Project. We are aiming to apply for the Series A funding round in early August.

# Looking Forward to Preview 2
Besides what we have already shown in the first preview, we'l be adding a bonding curve-powered TAppStore. The TAppStore allows for revenue sharing, investment, and hosting tApps plus a traditional app store.
