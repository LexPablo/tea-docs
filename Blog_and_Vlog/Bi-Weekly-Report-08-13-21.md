## TEA Project Updates

### Mining Contest Announced
After many rounds of testing, the TEA Project is proud to announce that our [browser wallet](https://wallet.teaproject.org/) is robust enough for its first significant test. To put the wallet through a full stress test, we're inviting users to join us in a mining competition.

To help contestants use the platform, we have prepared an [FAQ](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/FAQ:-Mining-Contest,-Preview-1) and [user's guide](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Checklist:-Mining-Contest,-Preview-1). We'll also have an English and Mandarin Zoom session for contestants to ask questions and watch a demo.

The mining contest launches in mid-August and is open to anyone with a Polkadot wallet. Our landing page for the contest is available at https://teaproject.org/landingpage/preview_1/

### Further Raft Consensus Developments
The TEA Project's use of the Raft consensus on layer-2 allows apps to run full speed. To achieve this, the layer-1Â blockchain must keep a list of trusted nodes on its blockchain. The TEA Project uses this layer-1 blockchain to reach consensus using the hardware-protected Proof of Trust data sent from the layer-2 nodes. We now have a [functional canary network](https://github.com/tearust/tea-camellia/tree/main/tests/canary-network) to work through adding these features to our 2-layer blockchain.
 
 ### New YouTube Explainer Video
 
 We've produced a new 2-minute explainer video to help users get up to speed on our project:

 ### Website Reorganization
    
We've decided on some changes to make finding information about the TEA Project easier for new users.

- Our [website](https://teaproject.org) going forward will be a repository of important information about the TEA Project. These topics will cover technologies that the TEA Project leverages, including WASM, IPFS, trusted computing, and Raft consensus.
    
 - Our [Github wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki) will feature more documentation on processes or features being worked on. We will also start using the related [Github discussions](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/discussions) to get more feedback from users on what should go into the documentation.

### Looking Forward to What's Next
Work is continuing on phase 2, including the bonding curve-powered TAppStore. Getting an app store that's attractive to both developers and curators remains a top priority. Even if developers believe in our tech, we want the bonding curves in the TAppStore to be able to add financial support to their projects. These developments will help position the TEA Project as a stronger candidate for its Series A funding round.
