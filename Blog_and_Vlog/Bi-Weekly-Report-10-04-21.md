# Epoch 3 Mining Contest Completed

Congratulations to the TEA Project epoch 3 mining contest winners. There were far few winners compared to epoch 2, but fewer winners sharing a larger 2000 USDT pot meant that the winners made out quite well.

One interesting note is that outside of one contestant, the big winners in this epoch were different from those at the top of the leader board in epoch 2. The earlier epoch rewarded contestants who focused on mining, while epoch 3 required branching out into TApp token investments in order to ascend the leader board. Our mining contests attempt to mimic dynamic economic ecosystems complete with exchange rates, unstable asset prices, and TApp creators who assign varying reward rates.

# Epoch 4 Mining Contest Has Started

Not a week passed from the September 24th end of epoch 3 before we launched our epoch 4 mining contest on October 1st. Some notables for the epoch 4 mining contest include:

-   Miner participation has exceeded 50 for the first time.
-   More YouTubers have published videos promoting the TEA Project and the contest. We’re currently up to 6 separate YouTube channels who have jumped in to promote the contest and expect a couple more to join while the contest is in progress.
-   TApps were introduced in epoch 3 but now make a crucial jump in epoch 4: they’re no longer controlled by the team. Aside from some example TApps, the majority of them have all been created by contestants:

TApps will eventually be created by devs independent of the TEA Project, so epoch 4 gives contestants a chance to experience running their own TApps and generating revenue from them.

# Looking Ahead to Q4

The development team has been hard at work implementing Kevin’s latest ideas into the TEA Project architecture. The newest development adds Proof of Time to TPM as a source of trust. We will publish a revised whitepaper that goes into detail about our updated state machine. The TEA Project continues to mature and evolve as we head into epoch 5 and approach our next funding round.
