# Epoch 6 Mining Contest Completed

The epoch 6 mining contest has completed with approximately 20 contestants and 4 YouTubers joining. Epoch 6 represented a major leap that required contestants to actually pay BUSDT to purchase contest CML vouchers. This new format might’ve cut down on the number of participants, but the ones who joined did so with even greater enthusiasm. Over 30 TApps were created by contestants, the largest number so far, with the new TEA Party social messaging app was the most popular TApp template.

The epoch 6 prize distribution is as follows:

# What’s Ahead for Epoch 7

The TEA Project keeps moving fast as we get closer to the mainnet launch. Users will notice the following updates and improvements in epoch 7:

-   Online upgrades are now available on the layer-2 blockchain. Miners will be notified that they need to upgrade their mining software by a certain time or else their node will be set to offline. We’ve had online upgradability for layer-1 since epoch 5, and now we can do the same style of updates for the layer-2 without having to restart the blockchain.
-   The TEA Party TApp template will undergo some upgrades. One of the biggest will be layer-1 notifications for TEA Party messages. It was inconvenient for users to log in to a TEA Party TApp and check if there were any new messages. This update will allow users to pay a small fee to have new message notifications show up directly in the TEA browser wallet.
-   Contestants will be able to purchase contest CML seeds at any time without having to purchase packages. This will give contestants more flexibility when purchasing their contest seeds.
-   Rewards will now be issued weekly instead of following a two week mining contest cycle length.
-   Rewards will be given out in mainnet CML coupons instead of USDT. Yes, that means we’re getting closer!

Epoch 7 testing will begin this weekend with the actual epoch set to start before the middle of December.
