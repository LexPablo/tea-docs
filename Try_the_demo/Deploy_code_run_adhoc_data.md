Before trying the "Deploy code first, run ad-hoc data" demo, please make sure you finished the ["Deploy data first, run ad-hoc code" demo](Deploy_data_run_adhoc_code.md).

Most of the steps are the same, so we are not going to repeat the instructions. 
# Deploy code

To deploy code, go to [deploy code demo](http://t-rust.com:8080/ipfs/QmRyNPQuQ7Aq1pZJxVskNJMGJceZgAgUcnAeeny7zBgkZu). If you are behind the China Great Firewall, use this [mirror](http://81.70.96.136:8080/ipfs/QmRyNPQuQ7Aq1pZJxVskNJMGJceZgAgUcnAeeny7zBgkZu) instead.

After deployed, make sure you copy and save the three deployment_ids of your code. Make sure you kept all of them.

# Run ad-hoc data

Then go to [run ad-hoc code demo](http://t-rust.com:8080/ipfs/QmdxbhK5x993mJ58DVUJutXmSricz1ueHKFxPqfPrKUPMG). If you are behind the China Great Firewall, use this [mirror](http://81.70.96.136:8080/ipfs/QmdxbhK5x993mJ58DVUJutXmSricz1ueHKFxPqfPrKUPMG) instead.

When prompted, paste the three deployment_ids. Run the task, and then you should see the result.
