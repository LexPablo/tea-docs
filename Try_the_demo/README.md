Before try any of these demos, please make sure you 
- read the [introduction](http://t-rust.com/#/demo) 
- installed required [extension](../FAQ/how_to_install_polkadot_extension.md)
- [created your own account](../FAQ/how_to_create_a_new_account.md)
- get some free tokens from our [faucet](../FAQ/how_to_get_free_test_token_to_start.md)

In this chapter, you will first try to run a simple "[easy start](Easy_start.md)" demo without deploying anything.

Then you can try to [deploy data first, then run adhoc data](Deploy_data_run_adhoc_code.md).

If that works, try a [reversed version, deploying code first, then run adhoc code](Deploy_code_run_adhoc_data.md).

At the last, you can run [create your own TEA node](Run_your_own_TEA_node.md) to be a miner.
