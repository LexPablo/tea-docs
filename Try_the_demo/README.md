In this chapter, you will first try to run a simple "[easy start](./Easy_start.md)" demo without deploying anything.

Then you can try to [deploy data first, then run adhoc data](./Deploy_data_run_adhoc_code.md).

If that works, try a [reversed version, deploying code first, then run adhoc code](./Deploy_code_run_adhoc_data.md).

At the last, you can run [create your own TEA node](./Run_your_own_TEA_node.md) to be a miner.
