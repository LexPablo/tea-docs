## Some Technical Details For Miners

- Miners who plant a CML into their mining machine automatically lay claim to the most productive staking slot, slot 0. The next staker occupies the less productive slot 1, and subsequent stakers are less productive the further away they get from the **0** slot.

- Each Camellia seed has a lifespan that mimics organic plants. A recently planted seed will hardly produce any TEA tokens, just as a Camellia tree nearing its end of life has a decreasing harvest. Part of the strategy of being a productive miner is determining when to cull trees and when to buy or sell surplus seeds.
- Each staking slot costs [//TEA]1000 and is automatically withdrawn from the user's wallet when they either plant a CML or stake without specifying a CML seed. If a miner doesn't have enough TEA tokens for the [//TEA]1000 buy-in, then they may take on debt. TEA token loans will only be for the beginning epochs and are designed to boost the supply of TEA in the early stages of the network. TEA is only ever farmed by miners, so there will be a lack of supply in the early stages as young CML seeds slowly grow into productive trees.
- Mining rewards pay out every 1000 blocks. Staking or unstaking are on the same block schedule and are available to users once every 1000 blocks.
