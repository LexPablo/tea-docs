# Basics-Founder's motivation, core members resume
## Kevin G. Zhang
The founder Kevin G Zhang, graduated from Tsinghua University, currently lives in Silicon Valley, USA. In 2015, when he was the CTO of Silicon Valley startup iHealth Labs, he discovered that one market need could not be met. At that time, iHealth Labs already had a large number of patients’ medical data. However, due to the strict regulation of the protection of medical data, it was barely used due to limitations of the Internet infrastructure at the time. Starting that point, Kevin had an idea to establish a trusted computing environment to protect patient privacy data. In 2017, he entered the blockchain industry and determined that was the best direction to solve that need.  He established ELK Insight LLC to continue his technical research. In 2018, he accepted Elastos outsourcing contract to be responsible for Elastos’ US and world (outside China) technical community development and promotion work, and later served as a member of CyberRepublic's community committee. Due to the fundamental inconsistency with Elastos technology, he insisted on the use of trusted hardware to achieve distributed computing. Elastos cannot be supported. One year later at the beginning of 2019, he left Elastos and started the research and development of the TEA Project, which has continued to this day.

## William Zhijun Zhang
Angel investor and technical consultant Dr. William Zhang Zhijun, graduated from Peking University and University of Maryland. He is currently the Chief Security Officer of the World Bank of the United Nations, responsible for the World Bank’s computer information security. He has a high reputation in the field of computer security. He has provided a lot of guidance and support since the beginning of TEA Project. He is also a big supporter of decentralized trusted computing. In the future, Dr. Zhang will be involved more in the marketing and operation for TEA Project.

## Jacky Li
Software engineer Jacky Li, graduated from Dalian University of Technology. He has been working with Kevin for more than 10 years in iHealth Lab and Elastos. He was a system architect at HP. 

## Raindust Mingzhi Yan
Software engineer  Mingzhi Yan, graduated from Wuhan University. He was the team lead of Elastos underlying team responsible for the blockchain protocol. Prior to TEA Project, he was engaged in artificial intelligence, multi-party secure computing research and development at Yuncong Technology.

Except for Zhang Zhijun who is still working full time at the World Bank,  all team members are working full time on the TEA Project. 

Since TEA Project is an open source project, there are a large number of part-time and community developers participating. These people are not listed in the core team, however, their IDs can be found on Github.
