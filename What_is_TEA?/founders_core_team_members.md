# Basics-Founder's Motivation, Core Members Resume
## Kevin G. Zhang
The founder, Kevin G Zhang, graduated from Tsinghua University and currently lives in Silicon Valley, USA. In 2015, when he was the CTO of Silicon Valley startup iHealth Labs, he discovered a market need that couldn't be met. At that time, iHealth Labs already had a large number of patients’ medical data. However, it was barely used due to the strict regulations protecting medical data and the inability of the Internet infrastructure at that time to protect it in transit. That became the starting point for Kevin's idea of establishing a trusted computing environment to protect patient privacy data. 

In 2017, he entered the blockchain industry and determined that it was the best direction to solve the privacy requirements for such important data.  He established ELK Insight LLC to continue his technical research. In 2018, he accepted Elastos outsourcing contract to be responsible for Elastos’s US and world (outside China) technical community development and promotion work. He also later served as a member of CyberRepublic's community committee. Due to the fundamental inconsistency with Elastos technology, Kevin felt that Elastos could not reach the trust necessary to safeguard critical data. His insistance on the use of trusted hardware to achieve distributed computing led him to leave Elastos in 2019. Kevin then began researching and developing the TEA Project, which has continued to this day.

## William Zhijun Zhang
Angel investor and technical consultant Dr. William Zhang Zhijun graduated from Peking University and the University of Maryland. He is currently the Chief Security Officer of the World Bank of the United Nations and is responsible for the World Bank’s computer information security. He has a high reputation in the field of computer security. He has provided guidance and support since the beginning of the TEA Project. He is also a big supporter of decentralized trusted computing. In the future, Dr. Zhang will be involved more in the marketing and operations for the TEA Project.

## Jacky Li
Software engineer Jacky Li graduated from the Dalian University of Technology. He has been working with Kevin for more than 10 years dating back to their time together at iHealth Labs and Elastos. He was in the past a systems architect at HP. 

## Raindust Mingzhi Yan
Software engineer Mingzhi Yan graduated from Wuhan University. He was the team lead of the Elastos team responsible for the blockchain protocol. Prior to TEA Project, he was engaged in artificial intelligence and multi-party secure computing research and development at Yuncong Technology.

## George Pornaras
Content marketer George Pornaras graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison with a degree in English. His past experience includes writing B2B content for cloud computing hosts, GPU mining, and participating in the genesis block events for Uniswap's UNI and Alchemix's ALCX token. He most recently worked as part of a dual China-United States remote team at Luminus, a manufacturer of LED lights.


Except for Zhang Zhijun who is still working full time at the World Bank,  all team members are working full time on the TEA Project. 

Since the TEA Project is an open source project, there are a large number of part-time and community developers as well as other roles participating. These people are not listed in the core team, however, their IDs can be found on Github.
