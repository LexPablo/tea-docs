## How did the TEA idea come from?

I wrote in my [sweeping monk blog](https://medium.com/@pushbar) about the history of the TEA idea in [English](https://medium.com/@pushbar/0-of-n-cover-letter-of-the-trusted-webassembly-runtime-on-ipfs-12a4fd8c4338) and [Chinese](https://medium.com/@pushbar/%E7%AC%AC0%E7%AF%87-%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E6%B8%8A%E6%BA%90%E5%92%8C%E6%8E%A2%E7%B4%A2%E8%BF%87%E7%A8%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%BF%AB%E8%BF%9B%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC-ecbb558ac36e). At the time when that blog was written I have not use the name "TEA". I just call it "Trusted WebAssembly Runtime on IPFS", which is too long and too technical. Soon after, I use the name "TEA" starting from my another blog post [Zen of TEA](https://medium.com/@pushbar/zen-of-tea-1-2480c8c249c3). Please click the link and read. It helps you understand the background of TEA project.
