# TEA stands for Trusted Execution and Attestation
[Internet is broken](Broken_internet_needs_a_fix.md), TEA is trying to [fix](How_TEA_fix_internet.md) it. TEA is a dApp platform based on many modern technologies, such as [IPFS](TEA_vs_IPFS.md), [Blockchain](./TEA_vs_blockchain.md), [Trusted computing](TEA_vs_Trusted_computing.md) and [Web assembly](../Try_the_demo/Easy_start.md). 
## TEA vs T-rust

TEA is the name of the project: TEA Project. TEA is also pronounced “T” as the initial of the word “Trust”.
T-rust is the name of the platform TEA project builds to run dApps. So far T-rust is the only product TEA project is working on. So sometime we use TEA and T-rust interchangably. Trust can be broken down to T and rust. Rust is the main programming language we used in our project (another two minors are Golang and Javascript). So Trust can be T-rust or Tea-Rust. This is how I give our project such a fancy name. 
# Our logo

Since it is called “tea”, the logo should be tea-related. So a cup of tea is my first idea.

In the beginning, I did not put the teabag in the logo. So you can't tell it is a cup of coffee or tea. Both of them are hot drinks. In order to distinguish from coffee, I added a teabag.
Well, it looks like a cup of tea now. But it is just a cup of tea. Nothing to do with hardware protected security. I move one step further. Now the teabag runs into a computer chip with a “lock” logo on it.

I asked my designer friend Nick to put all of those elements together. Bang! we got it!
