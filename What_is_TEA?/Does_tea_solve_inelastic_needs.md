The goal of TEA Project is to decentralize the cloud computing market. It shares the same goal as Dfinity's Internet Computer.

# Does it solve real needs? Are these needs inelastic? 
## Looking at needs from the decentralization of the cloud computing market

In recent years, privacy protection and information censorship of the traditional Internet caused by monopoly has become more and more problematic. The fundamental reason is that the current Internet model would inevitably form a centralized oligopoly. This not only impacts in the IT industry, but also in the entire social, cultural and even political fields.

Decentralization is a fundamental solution to this problem.

## Looking at needs from the next step of blockchain computing to the development of Web3

Contrary to the Internet, blockchain was originally created for decentralization. The computing power of early blockchain was very limited. It is caused by the blockchain consensus. Although there have been various improved schemes allowing blockchain to run faster and handle more applications, due to the limitations of the two roots of trust, cryptography and consensus algorithms, the user experience and computing scale of the Internet will not be able to be reached on blockchain in the future.

Only relying on cryptography and consensus algorithms for decentralized computing is not enough. Fundamental changes must be made to truly achieve the vision of Web3. Our approach is to add a hardware root of trust.


## Looking at needs from the perspective of miner FOMO

The popularity of IPFS's FIL and CHIA tells us the fact that, even if Web3 has not yet arrived, real consumer needs are to be prepared. As long as there is a token economic agreement allowing miners to FOMO, it will greatly boost a project value. This method of relying on financial forces to raise resources in advance is a large driving force of technological transformation. In the past, a large number of technological transformations have been promoted in this way, such as the aviation industry, and the Internet. Blockchain is facing the same driving force.
