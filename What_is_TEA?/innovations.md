TEA Project is very unique and innovative, from the design philosophy to the technology used. Although TEA uses a large number of open source technologies to build their security system, they have not seen other similar projects or traces of plagiarism. This is very similar to the originality of Bitcoin; initially designed by Satoshi Nakamoto: "Although the algorithms and technologies used by Bitcoin already exist, the originality of Bitcoin combined them to create a new era-the era of blockchain".
