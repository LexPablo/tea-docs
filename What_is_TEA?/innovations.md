The TEA Project is unique and innovative both from the design philosophy to the technology used. Although TEA uses a large number of open-source technologies to build their security system, the team has not seen any other similar projects or traces of plagiarism. This is very similar to the originality of Bitcoin; initially designed by Satoshi Nakamoto: "Although the algorithms and technologies used by Bitcoin already exist, the originality of Bitcoin combined them to create a new era - the era of blockchain."
