# Hypothesis of extreme situations

Currently, we have considered the following extreme situations as well as strategies to combat them.

## Unsecure of certain type of nodes caused by software or hardware

Any well-designed system will inevitably have bugs. As long as the number of nodes affected by the bug does not exceed 1/3 of the entire network, the problem can be resolved by updating and upgrading. In order to ensure that the 1/3 threshold is not exceeded, TEA Project uses diversity control and population control.
Any single type of CML seeds should not exceed 1/3 of the entire network. Once this number is approached, the number will be controlled when new CML seeds are added. This automatic adjustment avoids the potential risk of centralization and reduces the danger of the whole network caused by the unitary bug.
## DDoS Attack

Although DDoS is very hard to avoid, TEA can reduce the benefits of DDos attacks through anonymity and randomness. As long as valuable targets are mixed among all other valueless nodes, it's relatively safe.
When the number of nodes in the entire network reaches a certain level (for example, TEA modules are attached to a large number of IPFS mining machines), then the DDoS damage is minimal.
## What if people don’t believe in security of the TEA project

Any new piece of innovation will always be met with skepticism from the public. A great example is Bitcoin–– although it’s been around for 10 years, many still do not believe in its value. Although this is inevitable, TEA Project has adopted some strategies to shorten this process of doubt.

- Develop some convincing applications by ourselves. For example, Gluon Wallet has obtained Polkadot's Open Grant. It runs a hardware wallet service application on TEA, so that very large-scale funds can be protected on TEA's network. If these funds stay safe for a long time, people will naturally believe the TEA technology is safe. Bitcoin also proves its security in this way
- Bounty program
- Start with simple and low-risk applications and accumulate credit and reputation by time
