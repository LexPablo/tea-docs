TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, yet decentralized applications, also known as "Rich dApps." Unlike typical apps, Rich dApps are decentralized; they are completely serverless and run purely on miner's nodes like a blockchain.  However, Rich dApps run more like centralized cloud-based apps, with similar high scalability and user experiences. TEA Project combines good parts from both blockchain and cloud computing.

TEA Project has two layers, but unlike most layer-2 solutions that are trying to improve consensus algorithm, it is not attempting to improve blockchain; rather, TEA is taking and capitalizing on the benefits of it. In the TEA project, dApps code runs on layer-2, a Web Assembly runtime inside hardware protected enclaves. These hardware enclaves generate PoT (Proof of Trust) data handled by the blockchain consensus on layer-1. Therefore, in TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensus to verify the result of dApps code, but the execution environment where the code runs.

So the basic assumption is that: if the execution environment, code, and input data are trusted, then the execution result can be also be trusted. 

TEA Project is based on IPFS, Blockchain, Web Assembly, and Trusted Computing technologies. By adding a TEA hardware security module, the IPFS node can also serve as a computing node besides serving static content. IPFS turns to Inter Planetary Function-as-a-Service. 

TEA project has two tokens; TEA and Camellia. TEA token is a stable utility token as gas, while the Camellia token is an NFT that presents the credit and capability of a TEA mining node. The TEA token economy is an autonomous evolution ecosystem.
