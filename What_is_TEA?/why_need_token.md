# Is it Necessary to Solve These Needs Through Blockchain / Tokens?

On the centralized Internet, big companies profit from user data mainly by providing free services. They use these profits to build giant centralized cloud computing centers that provide computing power services for other small and medium-sized Internet companies. Cloud Computing is already the main source of income for several major Internet giants.

If centralized cloud computing would instead be dispersed through general crypto miners, the most immediate need is to pay service fees to offset the miners' operating costs. In order to achieve the anonymity and privacy protection of the Internet, a payment system that does not restrict anonymity by country or region is the best choice. Therefore, blockchain tokens are the best option. 

Web3 is a long-term and ambitious goal requiring long-term investment and huge capital support. Due to the nature of decentralization, it is unlikely to be organized and supported by companies or governments. Therefore, it can only raise funds to support development and deployment through decentralized finance markets. 

While the TEA project secures funds for development, early investors can also obtain capital returns through providing liquidity for the project.
