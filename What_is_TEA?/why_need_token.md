On the centralized Internet, big companies mainly profit from user data by providing free services. They use these profits to build giant centralized cloud computing centers which provide computing power services for other small and medium-sized Internet companies. Cloud Computing is already the main source of income for several major Internet giants.

If the centralized cloud computing is dispersed into the hands of general miners, the most immediate need is to pay service fees to offset operating cost. In order to achieve the anonymity and privacy protection of the Internet, a payment system that does not restrict anonymity by country or region is the best choice. Therefore, blockchain tokens are the best option.

Therefore, it can only raise funds to support development and deployment through decentralized finance markets. 

While TEA project obtains the funds for development, the investors can also obtain capital returns through liquidity in advance.
