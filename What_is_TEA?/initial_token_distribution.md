# Token Distribution And Unlock Liquidity Expectations
The two tokens in the TEA project are quite different: 

- The token [//TEA] will not have any initial distribution outside of mining. This distribution by block to miners is similar to Bitcoin's distribution method. [//TEA] is a complete utility token.
- CML is an NFT. Its seeds will be distributed to the team and investors through various rounds (seed round, series A and private sales, etc. ) Subsequent new seeds are automatically adjusted and generated according to the algorithm and auctioned off.

The initial liquidity can be started in public mining. If there is no centralized listing, IDO can be adopted first. Since the initial output is not large, the number of flows will not be large. Along with  more CMLs participating in mining, the number will increase.
