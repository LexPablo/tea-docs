# Token distribution and unlock expectations; when will it achieve liquidity?
The two tokens in TEA project are quite different: 

Token TEA will not have original distribution, all TEA will be mined. This is similar to Bitcoin. It is a complete utility token.
CML is a NFT. Its seeds will be distributed to the team and investors (seed round, series A and private sales, etc. ) Subsequent new seeds are automatically adjusted and generated according to the algorithm and auctioned.

The initial liquidity can be started in public mining. If there is no centralized listing, IDO can be adopted first. Since the initial output is not large, the number of flows will not be large. Along with  more CMLs participating in mining, the number will increase.
