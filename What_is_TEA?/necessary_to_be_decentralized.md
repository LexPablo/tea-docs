# Is it Necessary to Decentralized?

Centralized Internet and centralized cloud computing are mutually causal. If cloud computing cannot be decentralized, the Internet cannot be decentralized. It would be hard to imagine most of the processing power required of a decentralized peer-to-peer Internet being completed by a few giant cloud computing centers. 5G, edge computing, IoT, etc. are all working hard in order to solve the centralization problem of cloud computing from all different angles.

This article by Kevin Zhang, the founder of TEA Project, clarifies why the broken Internet needs to be repaired through decentralization.
