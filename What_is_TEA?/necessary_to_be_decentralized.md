# Is it necessary to be decentralized?

Centralized Internet and centralized cloud computing are mutually causal. If cloud computing cannot be decentralized, the Internet cannot be decentralized. It is hard to imagine that most of the processing power of a decentralized peer-to-peer Internet is completed on a few giant cloud computing centers. 5G, edge computing, IoT, etc., are all working hard in order to solve the centralization problem of cloud computing from all aspects.

This article by Kevin Zhang, the founder of TEA Project, clarifies why the broken Internet needs to be repaired through decentralization.
