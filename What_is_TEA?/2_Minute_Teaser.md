As we enter the Web 3.0 era, the TEA Project aims to solve the need for decentralized trust while performing complex computations on large data sets. The TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts "Rich dApps." These Rich dApps have high scalability while running on a distributed network of decentralized TEA mining nodes. The TEA Project aims to combine the power of cloud computing with the privacy of a decentralized blockchain solution.

The TEA Project is able to achieve its computational speed through what it calls Raft consensus among its decentralized mining nodes. Raft consensus is how the TEA Project avoids the need for Byzantine fault tolerance, a notoriously slow method or reaching consensus. Byzantine fault tolerance requires blockchains to continually check on the health of its nodes, and circumventing their slow processing speeds are an endemic problem of decentralized systems. The TEA Project leverages the Proof of Trust (PoT) data on layer-1 to reach consensus on the trustability of nodes on layer-2. 

In the TEA Project, dApps run Web Assembly code on layer-2 within hardware-protected enclaves. TEA's root of trust comes from miners' hardware that forms the distributed nodes of the TEA network. The current state of every dApp running on the TEA network is maintained by TEA nodes using the Raft consensus. The beauty of this setup comes from the layer-1 trust data that TEA mining nodes can poll to reach consensus. Each mining machine has an embedded TPM chip that generates PoT data. This PoT data is stored on TEA's layer-1 blockchain. 

TEA stands for **T**rusted **E**xecution and **A**ttestation, and it has a unique method of reaching a trustable consensus. The TEA Project uses consensus not to confirm the result of the dApp's code; it instead uses consensus to verify the execution environment where the code was run. TEA's philosophy is that **if the execution environment, code, and input data are trusted, then the execution result can also be trusted.**

Client blockchains can use TEA as a layer-2 to offload complex computations onto the TEA network. The client blockchain can verify the PoT data on TEA's layer-1 blockchain to verify that the returned execution result is trustable.

TEA's layer-1 is based on the Substrate framework from [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate). As a Substrate blockchain, TEA is natively compatible with the Polkadot network. TEA's layer-1 is also flexible enough to work with any other blockchain.

TEA Project's layer-2 currently uses the file storage and networking services provided by IPFS. Any current IPFS miner can begin participating in the TEA network by adding a TEA hardware security module (such as a Raspberry Pi with a TPM chip). The TEA Project effectively adds computing services on top of IPFS.

TEA project has two tokens; TEA and Camellia. TEA token is a stable utility token as gas, while the Camellia token is an NFT that's necessary for bringing a TEA mining node online.

The TEA Project offers the security of the blockchain combined with the scalability of cloud computing. It also offers privacy and censorship-resistance to its users without sacrificing decentralization. Visit us at [TeaProject.org](https://teaproject.org) to learn more.
