# Use Cases
The TEA Project is versatile enough to host dApps on its own ecosystem as well as act as a layer-2 for other blockchains. Here are a few examples of how the TEA Project is being used in crypto.

- [Gluon Secure Crypto Wallet](https://teaproject.org/#/doc_list/%2FBlog_and_Vlog%2FGluon_yet_another_crypto_wallet.md). The Gluon walet is built on top of the TEA project that can easily be integrated with other modern two-factor authentication solutions.

- [Adding Computing Functions to IPFS](https://teaproject.org/#/doc_list/%2FBlog_and_Vlog%2FTurn_ipfs_file_system_to_ipfs_function_service.md). IPFS miners can add TPM-enabled hardware to their machines and start offering services to the TEA network. IPFS miners would then be able to add "function as a service" to their storage services they provide on IPFS.
