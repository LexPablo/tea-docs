# Decentralization movement - The Internet is broken, and we are trying to fix it!
From [Zoë Corbyn](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoe-corbyn)'s 2018 article [Decentralisation: the next big step for the world wide web](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/08/decentralisation-next-big-step-for-the-world-wide-web-dweb-data-internet-censorship-brewster-kahle), 
> "The proponents of the so-called decentralised web – or DWeb – want a new, better web where the entire planet’s population can communicate without having to rely on big companies that amass our data for profit and make it easier for governments to conduct surveillance. "

and 


> "The DWeb, say proponents, is about giving people a choice: the same services, but decentralised and not creepy. It promises control and privacy, and things can’t all of a sudden disappear because someone decides they should."

If you didn't understand what he said back in 2018, you probably understand it now. Our existing Internet is broken, and the TEA Project is trying to fix it.

# The existing cures and remaining problems||||||||||=
There have been so many new projects released recently intent on fixing parts of the broken Internet. These innovations have included:
- IPFS provides a peer-2-peer file system that stores files in a decentralized manner.
- Blockchain, especially the Blockchain 2.0 era ushered in by Ethereum, provides a world computer where smart contracts can run in a decentralized manner.
- Trusted computing allows an originally untrusted node to become trusted through remote attestation. This elevated node is now trustable to store and transmit sensitive information. 
- WebAssembly has expanded beyond the boundary of web browsers. It can run on servers under a securely designed runtime.

Each of them fixed specific problems that looked promising for developing fully-featured dApps. However, each of them have unsolved problems making dApps impractical on their platforms.
- A file system is a necessary pre-condition for building a world computer, but it's not enough. Code is just a common type of data if it's not being executed in a CPU.
- Smart contracts currently cannot run complex algorithms. Attempts to do so have shown smart contracts to be too slow or too expensive as they lack the processing power of modern cloud computers. A layer-2 solution would be needed to offload the computation tasks as long as it could provide a similar trust level as the layer-1 blockchain.
- Trusted computing has been around for many years, but the limiting paradigm of **one-computer** = **one-metal-box** has set a hard boundary restraining its expansion. It needs the help of blockchain and other emerging technologies to expand beyond its current barriers.
- WebAssembly is still in its early stages. It needs practical use cases to become more popular. 

# TEA Project: thinking differently

It is impossible to use a single layer of tools to build a dApp platform. Combining all the latest technologies together, we can probably solve the various problems and fix the Internet. The TEA Project [[How_TEA_fix_internet|glues them together]] into a pure dApp platform.
