# Token model; How does the business support value/price? How does this model motivate the business?
## Token Model
TEA Project has two type of tokens: 
TEA (Tea) is a Utility token used to calculate fuel. Its value is anchored in the consumption of computing resources; consuming a TEA will always result in a fixed consumption (CPU time, network traffic and storage) computing service.
CML (Camellia) is a NFT. It is a necessary scarce resource to participate in the TEA project mining (Called tea picking). This NFT records various attributes of TEA Node, including processing capacity, credit history, life cycle, etc. CML has a life cycle - from seed germination, and growth, to eventually aging and withering. CML is a token with investment value and scarcity.

CML needs to be planted on the mining machine to generate income; this process is called tea picking. Earned TEA can be used to bid for seeds in order to expand production, or invest in other CMLs for passive income. They can be sold through trading.

Because CML (including seeds) can be traded, it retains its value. Since the token represents the ability to pick tea, they can be used for credit loans (rather than over-collateral of Defi), which means that future income can act as a collateral to obtain current income TEA.

## How will the business support token value in the long run?

The values of TEA and CML will need to be supported by business needs of decentralized cloud computing.

Not only can TEA provide services similar to computing Oracle for other blockchains, it can also provide cloud computing services for traditional Internet customers.

However, high demands for trusted cloud computing may take a long time to reach. Both IPFS, which has been running for many years and the latest Dfinity, news sto wait for the advent of the Web3 era. Before this era comes, everyone needs to rely on the miner economy to incentivize the development.
## How does miners' economy support token prices in the short term?

This logic is the same as the token price support of FIL, CHIA, and ICP. In the token design of the TEA project, Miners FOMO is specifically added in the token design of the TEA project. For example:

It takes a certain time for CML to germinate and grow from seeds. This avoids a large number of liquid TEA in the initial stage of the system from selloff pressure
CML and seeds are scarce resources. They need to be obtained through auctions. Auctions consume (burn) TEA. As CML matures, its price and value will increase. Because of this, early investment (buying seeds and cultivating them) will allow the investor to gain an advantage in future competition
TEA in a free flow state without gains and cannot be used for voting. It is similar to storing cash at home with possible depreciation. Investing TEA in CML will help maintain and increase its value, which is similar to purchasing stocks using cash. 
The return of investing in CML depends on its positions. The investment position is also a scarce resource. A wise investor should grab the bottom position (highest return)  of the early-stage CML. Once invested, it should not be easily taken out to avoid others occupying this position. This design encourages long-term stable lock-up investment.
Since mining is not large in the early stage, most miners (called tea farmers) may be willing to put the harvested TEA into reproduction or invest it; as a result, small amounts of TEA has already gotten early scarcity. Due to the menial selloff pressure, the cost of maintaining market value is not large, and the price is easy to control. As long as there is a certain amount of funds to raise prices in early stage markets, a virtuous circle of tea-picking investment, reproduction, and tea-picking can be formed. The TEA and CML for sale on the market will always be in a state of scarcity and insufficient supply to maintain a positive FOMO cycle
