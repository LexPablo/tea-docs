# TEA is layer-2 solution for blockchain

TEA project ties to blockchain closely. A lot of essential consensus algorithm runs inside our layer-1 component - the blockchain we build using Polkadot's substrate. 

However, we do not consider T-rust is a blockchain itself. It is more like a layer-2 oracle on top of existing blockchain because the main purpose of T-rust is not to run a self blockchain, but to run a computation oracle for other blockchains.
