Teaser document


TEA Project is considered either a decentralized cloud computing platform or a blockchain "accelerator." 
TEA sits between blockchain and dApps. It has two layers. The layer1 is a blockchain made with Substrate, layer2 is a hardware-protected WebAssembly runtime. Our clients' dapp (usually called the smart contract) runs in layer2 instead of layer1 blockchain. It runs at a native speed as traditional cloud computing. Layer1 is only responsible for running consensus to validate layer2's hardware proof of trust to guarantee layer2 to be trusted and secure. By introducing the hardware root of trust to existing blockchain consensus, TEA Project carefully combines the decentralization of blockchain, the security of hardware enclave, and cloud computing's high performance to be a new dApp platform. 

Not only empower typical dApps like Defi apps to run faster and less expensive, but TEA Project itself is also a Defi project. TEA offers three kinds of digital assetsâ€”the TEA token (T$) as gas powering the TEA network engine running. Credit token as a decentralized "credit score" to uplift Defi beyond the over-collateral limitation. Birth control headcount token creates the scarcity as well as prevent potential security concern caused by overpopulation. Miners can earn T$ and credit score by mining (Mining means provide trusted computing service to clients) and utilize their credit to borrow future money! 

The TEA Project is a DAO. No one or any entity controls over others. All miners whoever holds credit token can vote on major decisions, such as birth rate, decay rate, interest rate,  and executive committee members. 

The TEA Project plans to run a presale session soon. The presale is not selling any token, but the right of pre-mining before the main net is ready to serve to the public.  All of the funding from the presale is used for project development and network maintenance.
