# TEA Project Teaser document


TEA Project is considered either a decentralized cloud computing platform or a blockchain "accelerator." 
TEA sits between blockchain and dApps. It has two layers. The layer1 is a blockchain made with Substrate, layer2 is a hardware-protected WebAssembly runtime. Our clients' decentralized rich application runs in layer2 instead of layer1 (blockchain). It runs at a native speed as traditional cloud computing but remaining decentralized. Layer1 is only responsible for running consensus to validate layer2's hardware proof of trust to guarantee layer2 to be trusted and secure. By introducing the hardware root of trust to existing blockchain consensus, TEA Project carefully combines the decentralization of blockchain, hardware enclave security, and cloud computing's high performance to be a new dApp platform. 

$T or TEA is the cryptocurrency in the TEA ecosystem. Unlike other stable coins that are pegging to fiat, TEA pegs to the consumption of computing resources. Camellia (CML) is an NFT representing the qualification of mining. Camellia has its life cycle from nursery to RIP. Miners (we call farmers internally) need to bid for a limited Camellia supply to start mining. Investors (we call landlord internally) invest $T for the stake_slots of Camellia to earn the revenue share. A carefully designed task dispatching and revenue sharing algorithms keep the ecosystem balance between new and old, poor and rich. 

The TEA Project is a DAO. No one or any entity controls over others. DAO members use their stake to vote on significant decisions.

The TEA Project plans to run a presale session soon. The presale is not selling any token, but the right of pre-mining before the main net is ready to serve to the public.  All of the funding from the presale is used for project development and network maintenance.
